# Presentation   
If you're new to NeRF neural networks or want a comprehensive understanding of how this technology works, you're in the right place. In this series, we will explore:   
- The problem NeRF solves   
- The mathematical foundations of the technique   
- How the networks are structured   
- How to implement and train your own models   
   
We'll also discuss the limitations of the original method, improvements made over time, and what the future holds for NeRF technology.   
Feel free to jump straight to the sections that interest you via the table of contents. While some of the mathematical explanations are optional, we highly recommend understanding them to make the code easier to follow and adapt.   
### Prior Knowledge   
NeRF networks build on a lot of foundational concepts. We aim to simplify as much as possible, but if you're not familiar with the following topics, we recommend reviewing them before diving into NeRFs. You don't need to be an expert, but having a general understanding will help you grasp the ideas more easily.   
- Solving differential equations   
- General knowledge of neural networks:   
    - What an MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) is   
    - How a neural network is trained   
- Probability Distribution Functions (PDF) and Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDF)   
- Volumetric rendering   
- Normalized Device Coordinates (NDC)
